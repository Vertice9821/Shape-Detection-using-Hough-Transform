# Shape-Detection-using-Hough-Transform
This is a simple demo of shape detection using hough transform.

First, transform the source image into gray level.

Then, detect the edges of different shapes.

After applying hough transform, we can get circles and different shapes in red contour.

Finally, paint differen shapes with different colors.
