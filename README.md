# Shape-Detection-using-Hough-Transform
This is a simple demo of shape detection using hough transform.

First, transform the source image into gray level.
<div align=center><img width="150" height="150" src="https://github.com/Vertice9821/Shape-Detection-using-Hough-Transform/blob/master/images/src.png"/></div>
Then, detect the edges of different shapes.

After applying hough transform, we can get circles and different shapes in red contour.

Finally, paint differen shapes with different colors.
